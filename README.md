### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! This really has a MySpace feel to it, doesn't it? I wonder if I can set up some background tunes ðŸ¤”.

I'm mainly a PHP developer. Most of my work on GitHub is on **[Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii)**, a personal finance manager, and the associated tools.

But also interesting (even though I say so myself) are the following tools (for Firefly III) that you might find useful:

1. [Product manager](https://github.com/JC5/product-manager). A tool to manage costs and expenses of stuff you enter into Firefly III.
2. [Auto save tool](https://github.com/JC5/autosave). A tool to round up transactions saved in Firefly III.

Other stuff I'm working on:

1. I created basic Docker images for [wallabag](https://github.com/JC5/wallabag), [Monica](https://github.com/JC5/monica-multi-arch) and [TT-RSS](https://github.com/JC5/docker-ttrss) because there was nothing available that I could use. 
2. I forked an excellent [2FA library](https://github.com/JC5/google2fa-laravel) so I could improve its session management a little.
3. I use some [basic classes] to manage the Firefly III API(https://github.com/JC5/api-support-classes)
4. I forked a [Roam layout](https://github.com/JC5/better-roam-research) so I could change the font size.
