### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! This really has a MySpace feel to it, doesn't it? I wonder if I can set up some background tunes ðŸ¤”.

I'm mainly a PHP developer. Most of my work on GitHub is on **[Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii)**, a personal finance manager, and the associated tools and repositories. Some interesting ones are:

1. [The data importer](https://github.com/firefly-iii/data-importer/) that allows you to import CSV, CAMT.053 or bank data into Firefly III
2. The Firefly III [documentation](https://github.com/firefly-iii/docs)
3. The Firefly III [API documentation](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs/)

But also interesting (even though I say so myself) are the following tools (for Firefly III) that you might find useful:

1. [Product manager](https://github.com/JC5/product-manager). A tool to manage costs and expenses of stuff you enter into Firefly III
2. [Auto save tool](https://github.com/JC5/autosave). A tool to round up transactions saved in Firefly III

As you can see in the bottom left corner, a lot of people are sponsoring me for the work I do on Firefly III. I'm very proud to have such a nice group of people willing to support me. Thank you! :tada:
